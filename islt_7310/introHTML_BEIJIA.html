    <title>Welcome to Bei Jia's Website</title>

    Hey there,
My name is Yao Bei Jia. I am from China and am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Mizzou. I do not have any previous web application or development training experience, I hope by finishing this course, I will be able to build up my own web page. (Finger cross)
Other than my research, I have a lot of hobbies in my free time. I like biking, singing, and reading. Above all, the most exciting thing for me is cooking. I have always craved delicious food, luckily, I have a helper available 24/7 to satisfy my appetite if you have any recipes you want to share, we can always try to duplicate them. Yummy.
I have an orange tabby cat, his name is Clay, and he is about 5 years old now. I love him, but like all cats, he doesn't give me too much attention.
Yes, this is me. I am glad you are visiting my web page.
